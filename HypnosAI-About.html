                                                    <p>At Hypnos, Vaibhav oversees the alignment of the products with the consumer base. He ensures that all engineering work falls under the product vision without any extraneous deviation. Vaibhav also ensures that each product’s vision is understood within Hypnos and by third parties. Additionally, he connects with a multitude of high profile individuals and venture capital firms in order to build bonds, raise capital, and develop diverse networks.

                                                    Vaibhav became involved with Hypnos after an initial curiosity regarding Sathvik’s research on optical computing during AP Chemistry (while his other classmates were playing GeoGuesser). Coincidentally, Vaibhav was researching the private equity industry, when Sathvik brought up Hypnos’s need for capital. Consequently, Vaibhav has become committed to Hypnos over the past year as he balances the various intersections at Hypnos.

                                                    Prior to Hypnos, Vaibhav has interned at WUSTL - Olin for a social fintech project, where he scraped data from government databases (NHGIS) in order to help answer various questions regarding mortgage quality, race, and zip codes. In addition, he interned at GMU finance where he assisted with the development of a program that analyzed low cap stocks efficiently.

                                                    At Hypnos, Shaurya works on accounting, outreach, and talks to investors along with venture capital firms. Another one of his main roles is hunting for new opportunities that can benefit Hypnos in terms of finance and visibility.

                                                    Shaurya takes interest in everything he sees and loves to learn. Shaurya’s passion for optics began in his local library, where he would visit the shelf of physics novels, and always take home more books than he could read. Slowly, but surely, he would peruse through the stack of books, with the occasional glance at his laptop to search up terms he did not understand at the time. However, he soon began to wonder how he could apply the things he was learning to create something that could impact the world. Later that year, he was informed of his acceptance into the Thomas Jefferson High School Of Science and Technology (TJHSST), where he knew he would find his answers. Not long after, he came across a post by Hypnos looking for new members wanting to work on a project to build an optical computer. Shaurya knew this was the opportunity of a lifetime and applied without hesitation.

Shaurya has also worked on a team with other TJHSST high schoolers aiming to be the first high school team to launch a liquid fueled rocket to space, and a team building a fully autonomous humanoid robot.
