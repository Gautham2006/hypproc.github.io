As they grow, they will add some more products to our lineup such as devices that make integrating photonics to your lives as seamless as possible. They also created Apollo, a programming language designed for optical computing. Tachyon is their first deep learning hardware accelerator (computer chip), capable of both training and deploying the next generation of AI. Their integrated on-chip memory systems minimize opto-electric cross-talk, saving resources and allowing for easy scalability in data centers, research labs, and edge devices."

Sathvik Redrouthu is currently a student at TJHSST, and is the Founder, CEO, and CTO at Procyon Photonics, and builds company culture, raises capital, and establishes company focus based on the market industries. He also leads hardware design and software development, does SoC design, photonics design, coding, and grant work. Sathvikâ€™s interest in computers began when wanted to understand what happened under the hood when computer programs were run, down to the fundamental particles of reality. This launched him down an 8-year path of programming language theory (PLT), where he ended up building multiple compilers and virtual machines. He also designed multiple computers operating on different particles, ranging from electronics-based ones to ones running on water; using light was his next endeavor. The decision to go optical was a passing whim to see if a light-speed computer was possible, but Jagadeepram Maddipatla quickly understood the practical implications of an optical machine. The project evolved into an obsession and eventually a startup with a great team and functional prototypes."
